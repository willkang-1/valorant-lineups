            Valorant is a game which heavily relies on gathering information and playing around the enemy team.
            As such, agents such as Sova and Kayo/O have proven to be very useful for scouting out the enemy team with their utility.
            Whether it is Ascent A site, Haven C, or simply gaining mid control on all maps, there will always be a lineup that someone has found to get you the information you want.
            But remembering all of that without constant use/practice can be very difficult; as such, I have created this website to help new and experienced players remember some of these core lineups and help them win some games!

        <p class="page-content">
            While learning the positions of every enemy agent is important, what if you could simply win rounds by not even seeing the enemy?
            On the attack side, Viper and Killjoy have kits which allow them to win after planting the bomb (post-plant) with simple lineups to prevent the enemy team from defusing.
            On defense, Killjoy can also set up in very specific ways to prevent the enemy team from getting onto their desired site and even get some kills for free!
