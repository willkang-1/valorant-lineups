            Kay/O's abilities are some of the most basic, yet fundamental in this game.
            He has a flashbang, grenade, and a knife which is thrown to gather information on enemies.
            With this kit, he is able to not only help his team enter a site, but also prevent enemies from defusing the bomb after planting.
        </p>

        <p class="page-content">
            Unlike Sova, Kay/O's knife will have 0 bounces and a set initial velocity.
            As such, the images will be much easier to understand seeing as you will only ever have to get to the lineup spot and throw.
            However, the difficulty in Kay/O's lineups comes from his grenade since it requires line of sight to do damage.
